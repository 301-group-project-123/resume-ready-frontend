# Software Requirements Vision

## Vision

The main vision of our project is to create a way to find a movie to watch at a local theater near you. You are also able to save movies you are interested in, delete movies that you no longer find an interest in as well as leave reviews for movies you enjoyed or did not enjoy. It can be a struggle sometimes to find movies being shoed in your area, this will solve that. It gives you a wide range of selections to pick from and in the future you might even be able to sort it by genre.

## Scope (In/Out)

Our project will allow users to find movies locally.
This project will allow you to save movies you are interested in into your collection as well as delete them from your collection.
You can mark movies as watched or not as well as write reviews.
You can create your own profile.
Users can also learn more about the authors.
This website will not turn into an IOS or Android app in the near future.

## MVP

 This project will present you movies at theaters near you based on your provided Zip Code. It will give you the option to save, delete and leave reviews as a minimum viable product. Make it pretty.

 Stretch Goals: Display movies by Genre, Tell you which days are going to rain for best movie experience.

## Functional Requirements

The user can view movies locally, save movies to collection, delete movies from collection, leave reviews on movies in collection, mark watched or not.

## Data Flow

The user will start on the home page with navigation abr at the top if wanting to redirect. There will be a form in which you can enter your zip code, then below said form will display movies locally in area (within a limit, 10?). They can then browse their collection via the nav bar at top of page as well as check out our about page at the top. There will also be a profile nav at the top of page to access profile and a login/logout... button?

## Non-Functional Requirements

Cache, Security w/ OAuth, console.logs for testing, maybe breakpoints?

OAuth will authorize your identity and allow you to access page. This provides an extra step of security for our site. Cache will save your data locally and give users a better experience.
